- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashwin Anand
- 👀 I am passionate about developing software applications and that's why I am practicing programming languages like Java, which is one of the most popular languages to develop Android or Desktop-based applications. Recently, I have really liked working with C++ in the Computer Programming Course at Seneca College because that language gave me an important or core knowledge of how the concepts work that are usually abstracted from programmers in another languages.
- 💞️ I’m very fascinated and looking to collaborate on the languages which I have been learning, for example C++, Java and Python. I am also happy to contribute to front-end development, back-end development or database management.
- 📫 Please contact me if you have any opportunities at my email anandashwin868@gmail.com. I am open to learn or collaborate as of now.
