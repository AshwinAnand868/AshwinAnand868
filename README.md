- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashwin Anand
- 👀 I have interest in learning programming languages. Currently, I have really liked working with C++ in my course because that language gave me an important or core knowledge of how the concepts work that are usually abstracted from programmers in another languages.
- 🌱 I have just finished diploma as a Computer Programmer from Seneca college.
- 💞️ I’m very fascinated and looking to collaborate on the languages which I have been learning, for example C++, Java and Python. I am also happy to contribute to front-end development, back-end development or database management.
- 📫 Please contact me if you have any opportunities at my email anandashwin868@gmail.com. I am open to learn or collaborate as of now.
- Note: All my repositories are private and can be shown if needed.
